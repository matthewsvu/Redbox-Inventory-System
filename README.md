# Redbox-Inventory-System
# A CS 2336 project from Jason Smith that utilizes a custom Binary Search Tree to simulate Redbox's movie inventory.

You have been hired by Redbox to develop reports for vending kiosk around the US based on rental data transmitted from each unit. A file containing all of the transitions (rentals, returns and inventory maintenance) over a given time period will be analyzed so that a report can be generated. Your program will process each transaction and create a report listing all DVD titles and their quantities in the kiosk.

# Redbox-Inventory-System
: You have been hired by Redbox to develop reports for vending kiosk around the US based on rental data transmitted from each unit. A file containing all of the transitions (rentals, returns and inventory maintenance) over a given time period will be analyzed so that a report can be generated. Your program will process each transaction and create a report listing all DVD titles and their quantities in the kiosk.
